Folder contains all my coding practice related to the udemy course referenced below. 
The main bulk of coding is uploadid as a RAR file named "UdemyCourse - Complete.rar".
Link to the Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course

In the main RAR file coding is split into packages/sections,  in accordance to my actual course progress. Will be updating every time I complete another course section. Detailed information about course content and sections content can be found in the course description on Udemy.

Some of the (relatively) bigger sized Udemy coding challanges I will be adding as separate folders.
