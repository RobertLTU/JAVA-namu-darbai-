Folder contains all my coding practice related to the udemy course referenced below. 
The main bulk of coding is uploadid as a "rar" file, since there is simply too many files in one project folder.

Coding is split into packages/sections,  in accordance to my actual course progress. Will be updating every time I complete another course section. Detailed course and section content can be found in the course description on udemy.

Some of the (relatively) bigger sized Udemy coding challanges I will be adding as stand-alone projects (not inside of a section).
