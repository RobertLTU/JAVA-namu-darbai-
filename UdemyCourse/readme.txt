Folder contains all my coding practice related to the udemy course referenced below:
Udemy Course : https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course

Coding is split into packages/sections,  in accordance to my actual course progress. Will be updating every time I complete another course section. Detailed course and section content can be found in the course description on udemy.

Some of the (relatively) bigger sized Udemy coding challanges I will be adding as stand-alone projects (not inside of a section).
